# Simple Form Validator

This is a super simple vanilla JavaScript form validator. It's specifically written so as not to have any dependencies on jQuery or other libraries. It's super basic and probably won't solve all the worlds problems when it comes to validation, but it definitely does the trick for basic front end form validation.
